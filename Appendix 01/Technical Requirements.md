# Technical Requirements

The Java software development kit (JDK), version 21 or higher, must be used with the most popular Java IDEs: Eclipse/IntelliJ/Visual Studio Code/NetBeans and Spring Boot 3. This book uses the MacOS operating system, but all tools are also available for Windows and Linux. You can get the JDK installation package from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/), or you can use OpenJDK versions as well.

> Important Note

- All the Book source code and material are in the Book's official GitHub repository: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Architecting-High-Scalable-Applications-with-Java-).
