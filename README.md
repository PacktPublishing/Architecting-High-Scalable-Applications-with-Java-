## About the Book

This book is structured into four main parts, each focusing on a critical aspect of building high-scalable applications:

1. **Microservice Architecture and Design Considerations**: Learn the fundamentals of microservices and how to design robust layers for data, business, and services.
2. **Scalability Operations Management**: Explore strategies and tools to manage containerized deployments and scaling operations effectively.
3. **Operational Excellence at Scale**: Understand how to maintain system resilience, ensure fault tolerance, and implement observability in complex ecosystems.
4. **Scalability Miscellaneous Topics**: Delve into advanced topics, including integration patterns, security considerations, cloud migration, and disaster recovery planning.
